## What are the root causes for application performance drop?

There are only three
1. Inefficient Slow Processing ![[Pasted image 20241111182709.png]]
2. Serial resources Access ![[Pasted image 20241111182746.png]]
3. Limited resource capacity ![[Pasted image 20241111182845.png]]

 ==Note: We should always try to avoid building queues when designing a new system or find where the queue building in an existing system==

## Performance Principal

1. Efficiency 
2. Concurrency 
3. Capacity
